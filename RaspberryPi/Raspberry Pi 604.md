# Raspberry Pi 604

*Built by Shun Zhang, Donghao Li & Zhankui He*



## 1. Get started

### 1.1 Get a system

- Requirements (hard-ware):
  - RaspberryPi 3B+ (maybe 3B could also work)
  - Power supply
  - SD card (with SD card reader), more than 8G
  - (*) An HDMI screen, also it's power supply and the HDMI connection (which is recommended for Desktop users; enabling SSH does not need a screen)

There are many systems designed for RaspberryPi (3B+/3B), such as Raspbian, windows and so on. Here we choose the official one, [Raspbian(4.14)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/). (you may find other versions on the official website)

- Requirements (software):
  - Downloaded [Raspbian(4.14)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) (zip file)
  - [SD card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/)
  - [Win32DiskImager](http://sourceforge.net/projects/win32diskimager/)

With all the preparations above, we can now equip our Pi with an operating system! 

Follow the steps:

 	1. Format your SD card as **FAT32**,  using [SD card Formatter](https://www.sdcard.org/downloads/formatter_4/)
	2. Unzip your Downloaded [Raspbian(4.14)](https://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads/raspbian/) and copy all the files into your formatted SD card
	3. Safely pull out your SD card and gently insert it into your Pi
	4. Power up your Pi and the system should work
	5. (*) If you have a screen, then after proper connections, you will actually see the Raspbian system running on the screen.
	6. (*) Also, if you want to use it like a normal computer, than you need a mouse and a keyboard. For Pi users, an integrated mouse-board with Bluetooth connection is recommended.

Till here, the Pi is 'no different' from a normal computer.



### 1.2 Get WIFI connection

- Requirements (hard-ware):
  - A WIFI to connect
